DESCRIPTION
-----------
Too many files!  Will have to reorganise things.
   Michael's note:  require can be a bit weird with items in subfolders.

Investigating
-------------
It was very easy to move the images and sounds to an assets subfolder.  newSource, newImage, etc. are fine with filenames that have directories.
   If I want to put lua folders in subdirectories, then it seems that:
1) I can either mess around with package.path to put the subdirectories in package.path
2) require('subfolder.filename.lua') might work.

Putting lua files in subfolders
-------------------------------
I tested this by putting assets.lua in the assets subfolder, then changing the require statement in love.load() as follows:

require('assets.assets');

This worked.

I am considering if I need to do this.  With the asset files in their own subfolder, the listing of files will now fit on one screen again.
