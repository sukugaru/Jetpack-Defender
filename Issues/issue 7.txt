Seeing as I don't have android and getting things onto my old iPhone will be too frustrating, my mobile device target is now my laptop.

My base/design resolution is 640 x 360, for the 16:9 aspect ration.

Then in love.load() I get the actual resolution, and from that I can get a scaling factor.

e.g.

baseRes.x = 640;
baseRes.y = 360;

require assets

scaleX = baseRes.x / lib.windowWidth;
scaleY = baseRes.y / lib.windowHeight;

And then, to make sure calculations based on windowWidth and windowHeight are correct, also do:

lib.actualWidth = lib.windowWidth;
lib.actualHeight = lib.windowHeight;

lib.windowWidth = lib.windowWidth * scaleX;
lib.windowHeight = lib.windowHeight * scaleY;



love.draw
love.graphics.scale(scaleX, scaleY);
look into push and pop



This *should* mean that the various draw functions don't need any major rework.
