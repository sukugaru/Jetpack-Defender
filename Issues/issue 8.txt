Adding in a full invasion mode.

game.lua v0.1.6
Introduced a fair few number of things!
scorePerEnemy to show how many points an enemy gives.
FIScorePerEnemy to show how many points an enemy is worth during fullInvasionMode

enemiesPastYou - how many have gone off the screen?
fullInvasionLimit - how many are allowed to get past you?
fullInvasionMax - how many will spawn during FI mode?
fullInvasionMode - true if in full invasion mode

progressBar - to display an invasion progress bar

game:startFullInvasion()
Sets a few variables and starts this mode

game:draw()
Draw the progress bar and a red tinge over everything in full invasion mode



Fixes
Also noticed that if you click on the start button, the title screen goes straight to gameplay, and doesn't go to the levelIntro state.  Need to fix this!
titleScreen.lua v0.1.5
