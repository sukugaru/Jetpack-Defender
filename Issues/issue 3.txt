Pausing is currently done by player.lua and is down by looking for an isDown on escape.  This is obiouvsly causing the problem.

Trying out a fix:
 - Removing the isDown(escape) from player
 - Putting a check on escape in game.keypressed

Testing:
 - Press escape in game and make sure it still pauses (yes)
 - Press escape again and make sure it unpauses (yes)
 - Press space in pause mode and make sure it unpauses (yes)
 - Press space in game and make sure it doesn't pause.  (No)
   Was overzealous in copying code over.  Removed space bar from the 'go into pause mode' check.

Code changes
game.lua (v0.1.2)
player.lua (v0.1.1)
