ControlBoost, ControlShoot, and ControlPause functions that can check all the possible input sources.

Part done - ControlBoost and ControlShoot are done in player.lua, but don't handle touchscreen input.
Additionally, ControlPause is a bit trickier because we need to use keypressed and mousepressed (is there a touchPressed function?) to initiate.

---------
The mobile device being targeted is a laptop (it counts as a mobile) so we don't strictly need touchscreen inputs.  I'm investigating anyway for completeness.

keypressed and mousepressed could set a variable saying PausePressed and then in update, when we detect PausePressed = true, initiate pause mode.

------------------------
touchscreens are handled by the callback love.touchpressed or by love.touch.getPosition.

The closest to isDown for touchScreen inputs is something like this:

    (From https://love2d.org/wiki/love.touch.getPosition)

    local touches = love.touch.getTouches()
 
    for i, id in ipairs(touches) do
        local x, y = love.touch.getPosition(id)
	-- do something...
    end

I've put this into my code, with a touch on the leftside of the screen doing a boost, and a touch on the right side doing a shoot.  To see if this could work, I've modified the mouse code so it follows this same behaviour.

I'm using mouse input to simulate what I want touchscreen inputs to do:
 - Hold LMB down on left side of screen - gives the player a boost
 - Hold LMB down on right side of screen - shoots
 - Click on the UI in the top part of the screen - pauses
 - When paused, click anywhere to unpause.
