High Scores
-----------

Previous sessions and work on this shows we need this:

 - highscores table
 - clear it in love.load
 - then load from highscores.dat file, also in love.load()
 - Save the player's score to the highscores table in gameOver:start()

 - function saveHighScores() - I just need to do:

function saveHighScores()
	local scores = "";
	for k, v in pairs(highScores) do
		scores = scores .. game.score .. "\r\n";
	end
	
	love.filesystem.write("highscores.dat", scores);
	
end

Super simple but I know it works.

Files being touched:
main
New version v0.1.3
love.load loads the highscores and puts them into highscores table

gameOver
New version v0.1.3
in gameOver.start the player's score is put into the highscore table
highscore table is saved

titleScreen
New version v0.1.3
interprets highscores and generates a string with the highscores in it
displays that string during the title sequence
